# The Button That Does Nothing

A hilariously useless web project: a button that looks important, invites you to click it, and… absolutely does nothing. Perfect for procrastination, confusion, or just a good laugh.

## 🤝 How to Contribute

## 🧭 Contribution Guidelines

Before you start:

1. **Check existing issues** and their assignees before working on something new.
2. If you plan to add something new, **create an issue** first, describe your idea, and get assigned to it.
3. Please **use clear, standard file names** (avoid AI-style or random names like “Enhanced”). You can still use creative descriptions in your **commit messages**.
4. For large updates, **split your changes into multiple commits** for easier review.
5. If you’re unsure about something, feel free to **discuss it in the issue thread or in the Discord chat** — collaboration keeps things fun and smooth!

# 1. Fork the repository
# 2. Create a new branch for your feature or fix
git checkout -b feature/my-awesome-useless-feature

# 3. Make your changes and commit them with a clear message
git commit -m "Add bouncing effect to the button"

### 💡 Remember:

Have fun, be creative, and never forget - **the button still does nothing.** 😄


Would you like me to make this README a bit **shorter and cleaner for GitHub’s front page**, or keep it **detailed and community-style** like above?
